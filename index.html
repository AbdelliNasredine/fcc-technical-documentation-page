            <h3>What is JAVA ?</h3>
            <p>Java is a programming language and a computing platform for application development. It was first
                released by <b>Sun Microsystem in 1995</b> and later acquired by Oracle Corporation. It is one of the
                most used
                programming languages.</p>
            <h3>What is Java Platform ?</h3>
            <p>Java platform is a collection of programs that help to develop and run programs written in the Java
                programming language. Java platform includes an execution engine, a compiler, and a set of libraries.
                JAVA is platform-independent language. It is not specific to any processor or operating system.

            <h3>What's JVM ?</h3>
            <p>JVM is a engine that provides runtime environment to drive the Java Code or applications. It converts
                Java bytecode into machines language. JVM is a part of JRE(Java Run Environment). It stands for Java
                Virtual Machine</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In other programming languages, the compiler produces machine code for a particular system. However,
                    Java compiler produces code for a Virtual Machine known as Java Virtual Machine.</li>
                <li>First, Java code is complied into bytecode. This bytecode gets interpreted on different machines
                </li>
                <li>Between host system and Java source, Bytecode is an intermediary language.</li>
                <li>JVM is responsible for allocating memory space.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How to Create Your First Java Program</h3>
            <p>You need the following 2 software to create your first Java Program</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>The Java SE Development Kit</b> please refere to this link to
                    <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html" target="_blank">download and install JDK</a></li>
                <li><b>A Text Editor / IDE</b> Any text editor will do the job just fine but we recommend you to install
                    an IDE like <b>eclipce</b> or
                    <b>inteljIDEA</b> </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps to Compile and Run first Java program</h3>
            <p>Open your text editor or IDE , and create a new file and copy the below code :
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                <code>
                    public class MyfirstProgramInJava {
                    public void main(String[] args) {
                    System.out.println("Hello World");
                    }
                    }
                </code>
            </div>
            <p>Save the file as <b>FirstProgram.java</b> (make sure that the files has <b>.java</b> extenstion )</p>
            <p>Open the command prompt / terminal . Go to Directory where you have saved the file. Compile the code
                using command :</p>
            <div class="code">
                <code>
                    javac FirstProgram.java
                </code>
            </div>
            <p>If you look in your working folder, you can see that a file named <b>A.class</b> has been created.</p>
            <p>To execute the code, enter the command java followed by the class name, as expected output Hello World is
                displayed now.</p>
            <div class="code">
                <code>
                    java A
                </code>
            </div>
            <p>
                <b>Note:</b> Java is case sensitive Programming language. All code, commands, and file names should is
                used in consistent casing. <b>FirstProgram</b> is not same as <b>firstprogram</b>.
            </p>

            <h3>What is OOPS</h3>
            <p>Object Oriented Programming is a programming concept that works on the principle that objects are the
                most important part of your program. It allows users create the objects that they want and then create
                methods to handle those objects. Manipulating these objects to get results is the goal of Object
                Oriented Programming.</p>

            <header>Java Variables</header>
            <h3>What is a Variable</h3>
            <p>A variable can be thought of as a container which holds value for you, during the life of a Java program.
                Every variable is assigned a data type which designates the type and quantity of value it can hold.</p>
            <h3>Variable Declaration</h3>
            <p>To declare a variable, you must specify the data type & give the variable a unique name. Examples of other Valid Declarations are :</p>
            <div class="code">
                <code>
                        int a,b,c; <br>

                        float pi; <br>
                        
                        double d; <br>
                        
                        char a; 
                </code>
            </div>
            <h3>Variable Initialization:</h3>
            <p>To initialize a variable, you must assign it a valid value. Example of other Valid Initializations are :</p>
            <div class="code">
                <code>
                        pi =3.14f; <br>

                        do =20.22d; <br>
                         
                        a=’v’; <br>
                </code>
            </div>
